            Salvation is a gift that is made available to those who repent, believe and confess that Jesus is Lord and that He died and rose from the dead to save mankind (Acts 16:31; Romans 10:9-10). This gift cannot be earned through good deeds or by simply being “good” (Ephesians 2:8; 1 Timothy 1:9). It is a matter of faith (acting out on what you believe according to God’s Word concerning salvation).

            Pray this prayer: “Heavenly Father, I come to You in the Name of Jesus. Your Word says, ‘Whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved’ (Acts 2:21 ). I am calling on You. I pray and ask Jesus to come into my heart and be Lord over my life according to Romans 10:9-10. ‘If thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.’ I do that now. I confess that Jesus is Lord, and I believe in my heart that God raised Him from the dead.”

            If you have prayed this prayer we would like to know and send you a free gift that will help you grow in the Lord…
